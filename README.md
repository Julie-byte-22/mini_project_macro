# mini_project_macro

Description of the project

Bergolt et al. 2022 are the first to use time series methods on macroeconomic data to better understand the decline in the labour share in the United States. They apply a unified theoretical framework to compare the four drivers and show that automation and an increase in firm market power are contributing most to the observed decline. In a first step, this project aims to replicate the selected paper using the provided replication package. The second part of the project extends the paper by applying the same theoretical framework to additional employment variables, complementary to the labour share. The focus of the extension is thus to investigate structural change on the employment share, the unemployment rate and the labour force participation rates (LFP) by gender. For unemployment and LFP, data availability allows for an analysis by ethnic status.
